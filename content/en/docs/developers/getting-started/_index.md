## Welcome, Developers

This page orients you to the developer documentation. Start here, then dive into the SDK and plugin guides.

## Plugin Development Overview

Privateer plugins are community-driven validation modules that can be developed and maintained independently. Plugins use the Privateer SDK to integrate with the core framework.

### Why Develop Plugins?

- **Extend Functionality**: Add support for new cloud providers, services, or validation rules
- **Community Contribution**: Share your validation logic with the community
- **Standardized Interface**: Use the SDK to ensure consistent behavior across plugins
- **Reusable Logic**: Leverage common utilities and cloud provider logic from the SDK

## What you’ll need

- Go 1.19 or later
- Access to the infrastructure or services you want to validate
- A working Privateer CLI (see **For Users** if you need to install)

## Where to go next

- **Get to Know the SDK**: Learn the Privateer SDK interfaces, utilities, and core components.  
  → [/docs/developers/sdk/](/docs/developers/sdk/)
- **Create a New Plugin**: Generate, build, and ship plugins using the SDK.  
  → [/docs/developers/plugins/](/docs/developers/plugins/)
